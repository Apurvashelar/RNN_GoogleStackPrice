# RNN_GoogleStackPrice

### Description  

Here we've a dataset of Google Stock Prices from year 2012 to 2016. And we will gonna predict the stock prices for a month January 2017 using the concept of RNN.
For this we will make an LSTM model that will try to capture the downward and upward trend of the Google stock price. And LSTM is the most powerful model that can do this. For the same, here we've added LSTM layers with dropouts and regularization to avoid overfitting. We've trained our LSTM model on five years of the Google stock price and this is from the beginning of 2012 to the end of the 2016, based on this we'll try to predict the first month of 2017.  

### Predicted Result
